FILES
-----
* Roomba.java is the main class.
* The experiments for evaluating the performance of single source and all pairs shortest path algorithms with different randomly generized floor plan data sets are conducted.
* A visulization of floor plan and shortest path found by given the location of roomba and docking station is made to prove the correctness.
* There is no data set files since the floor plan is randomly generated in the program by given size N.
* The code of project is modified from the reference: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/

COMPILATION
-----------
